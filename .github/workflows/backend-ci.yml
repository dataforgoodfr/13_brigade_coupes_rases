# This workflow will do a clean installation of python dependencies, cache/restore them, build the source code and run tests across different versions of python.
# It uses Poetry to manage dependencies and pytest to run tests.
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
