## Setup

Install the dependencies in a virtual environment:

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.create true
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install --with analytics
source .venv/bin/activate
```

We also need [GDAL](https://gdal.org/en/stable/) to handle some geospatial data processing.
We are installing it separated from Poetry due to system-specific dependencies.
For Ubuntu/Debian, install GDAL using your system's package manager:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
```

Confirm that GDAL was installed successfully:

```bash
gdalinfo --version
```

To use GDAL in Python, install the matching pip package:

```bash
sudo apt install python3.13-dev
pip install gdal==<your GDAL version>
```

Ensure GDAL is properly installed and can be imported:

```python
from osgeo import gdal
```

## How to download the preprocessed data

- Get your Scaleway credentials from Vaultwarden.

- Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions).
  You can also use the [Scaleway CLI](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cli/) directly if you prefer.
  This guide covers the AWS CLI for now, as it is more widely used.

- Create or update your `~/.aws/config` file:

  ```
  [profile d4g-s13-brigade-coupes-rases]
  region = fr-par
  services = d4g-s13-brigade-coupes-rases


  [services d4g-s13-brigade-coupes-rases]
  s3 =
    endpoint_url = https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
  s3api =
    endpoint_url = https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud
  ```

- Create or update your `~/.aws/credentials` file:

  ```
  [d4g-s13-brigade-coupes-rases]
  aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
  aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
  ```

- Run the following command to list the files that will be downloaded from S3:

  ```bash
  aws s3 ls s3://brigade-coupe-rase-s3/analytics/data/ --recursive --profile d4g-s13-brigade-coupes-rases
  ```

- Run the following command from the root of your project to sync local files with the S3 data storage:

  ```bash
  aws s3 sync s3://brigade-coupe-rase-s3/analytics/data/ analytics/data/ --exact-timestamps --profile d4g-s13-brigade-coupes-rases
  ```
